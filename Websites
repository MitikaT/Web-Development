Accessing Websites 
    1. Your browser sends a message to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
    2. Your ISP relays the message to a DNS (Domain Name System) server. 
    3. The DNS server looks up the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the website you want to access and sends it back to your browser.
    4. You send a direct request to this address (has the server of the website) through your ISP via the Internet backbone.
    5. The server sends the files back and the website is shown.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) – responsible for the structure of the website
